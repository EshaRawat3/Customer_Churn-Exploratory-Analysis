## 📊 Customer Churn – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project focuses on **exploratory data analysis of a telecom customer churn dataset** to understand customer behavior, service usage patterns, and factors influencing churn. The analysis combines **quantitative metrics (counts, percentages, distributions)** with **qualitative insights** to identify trends across customer services.

### 🔍 Key Objectives

* Analyze customer adoption of core and add-on telecom services
* Identify patterns in service usage that may influence churn
* Generate actionable insights using visual and statistical analysis

### 🧮 Analysis & Insights

* Over **90% of customers have PhoneService**, while **MultipleLines usage is nearly evenly split** between single-line and multi-line users.
* **Fiber optic internet accounts for ~40–45% of customers**, followed by **DSL (~30–35%)**, with **20–25% having no internet service**.
* Add-on services such as **OnlineSecurity, TechSupport, OnlineBackup, and DeviceProtection show low adoption**, with **55–65% of customers not subscribed**.
* **StreamingTV and StreamingMovies display balanced adoption (~50% Yes / 50% No)**, indicating higher engagement with entertainment services.

### 📈 Tools & Techniques Used

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy) for data cleaning and manipulation
* **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for univariate and multivariate visualization
* **Countplots, distribution analysis, and categorical comparisons** for EDA

### ✅ Business Value

The analysis highlights that customers prioritize **core connectivity services** over optional support features, suggesting opportunities for **targeted upselling and retention strategies**. These insights can help telecom businesses design **cost-effective service bundles** and **churn reduction initiatives**.
